# Comic Downloader

This script downloads comic page images from a website.

## Usage
1. Run `python comic_downloader.py`.
2. Enter the base website URL containing the list of issues.
3. Provide the starting and ending issue numbers (1â€‘based).
4. Choose the folder where images should be saved.

The script uses Selenium to open each issue, selects the **All pages** option, waits 10 seconds for images to load and then downloads each image. Relative links are automatically converted to full URLs.

Dependencies: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `selenium`, `tkinter` (usually included with Python) and a Selenium WebDriver (e.g. Firefox geckodriver).
